## What is a "robotic fabric"?

In today’s world, robotics has become part and parcel of one’s everyday life. One of the more ambitious and innovative branches of robotics is the branch of **“soft robotics.”** This involves flexible and more motile robot bodies rather than rigid ones. A practical operation of the soft robotics branch is the recently discovered **“robotic fabrics”** innovation.

A robotic fabric is essentially a fabric that includes applications like **actuation,** sensing, and variable stiffness while retaining all the qualities that make the material so useful - **flexibility,** breathability, small storage footprint, and low weight. The actuation components are designed so that they do not affect the weight and volume of the fabric.

## Features

Until recently, robotic fabrics were attached to **external machines** that modulate factors inside them, such as shape, sensors, or air pressure. Now, the emergence of fibers that can sense and alter structurally means that engineers can impart **automatic functions** into textiles — and open up a world of possibilities. One such innovation is the concept of **breathable garments.**

  }}

Breathable garments are new types of fabrics that could help athletes and performers train their breathing and could be developed further to help **hospital patients.** MIT researchers have created clothing that senses how much it is being stretched/compressed and provides **immediate tactile feedback** through pressure, stretch, or vibration. They contain a fluid channel in the center, which gets activated as the system pressurizes and **releases compressed air/water** into the drain, allowing the textile to act as an **artificial muscle.**

Researchers envision that it could help train singers or athletes to control their breathing better and even help patients recover from respiratory diseases like **COVID-19.**

A multidisciplinary group from Wyss Institute for biologically inspired engineering (Harvard) has developed **Smart Thermally Actuating Textiles (STATs)** — soft textile robots that could enable new therapies for **injury rehabilitation.** They induce electrical liquid-vapor phase change as a response to disturbance. They can prevent injuries from happening in the first place by applying forces at **specific frequencies,** for example, preventing pressure sores in bedridden / wheelchair-using people.

Researchers at Yale University have been working on the uses of robotic fabrics in **space travel,** for instance, **compression garments.** They have developed a specific type of material that includes properties like actuation, sensing, and variable stiffness, while at the same time retaining all the generic properties of a soft fabric like flexibility, breathability, compactness, and low weight.

This research has been funded by the **Air Force Office of Science Research.** Demonstrations have shown that the design can turn itself from a flat fabric into a standing, load-bearing structure and even a **small airplane.**

## Conclusion

In conclusion, robotic fabrics are an inevitable and integral part of the near future and are bound to become a day-to-day entity in every household.
