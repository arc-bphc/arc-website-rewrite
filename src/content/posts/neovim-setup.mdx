Neovim is a modern rewrite of Vim that adds performance improvements and extensibility. Paired with [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/), a feature-rich and highly customizable Neovim config, you can create a beautiful and powerful coding environment.

This guide walks you through setting up Neovim with NvChad on **Ubuntu 22.04 or later**.

---

## Why NvChad?

* üé® **Beautiful UI**: Out-of-the-box themes, file trees, and icons.
* ‚ö° **Fast**: Built with performance in mind.
* üß© **Modular**: Easy to add plugins and personalize keybindings.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Pre-configured**: No need to start from scratch.

---

## Prerequisites

* Ubuntu 22.04 or later
* Basic familiarity with the terminal
* Git installed:

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install git
  ```

---

## Step 1: Install Neovim (Latest)

The Ubuntu repo may have an older version, so we'll use the official AppImage or PPA.

### Option 1: AppImage (Recommended for latest stable)

```bash
wget https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest/download/nvim.appimage
chmod u+x nvim.appimage
sudo mv nvim.appimage /usr/local/bin/nvim
```

Check installation:

```bash
nvim --version
```

### Option 2: Use PPA

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install neovim
```

---

## Step 2: Install Nerd Fonts (Optional but Recommended)

NvChad uses **icons** that require a patched font like [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts
cd ~/.local/share/fonts
wget https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/latest/download/FiraCode.zip
unzip FiraCode.zip
fc-cache -fv
```

Then set your terminal to use **FiraCode Nerd Font**.

---

## Step 3: Install NvChad

‚ö†Ô∏è This will override your existing Neovim config at `~/.config/nvim`!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad ~/.config/nvim --depth 1
nvim
```

This will trigger NvChad's first-time setup and plugin installation. Wait for it to complete.

Absolutely! According to the official NvChad documentation and community sources:

You can **open the theme selector UI** using this keybinding:

```
<leader> + t + h
```

Where `<leader>` is the spacebar by default. ([nvchad.com][1])

A tutorial confirms the sequence more specifically:

```
Press <Space>, then t, then h
```

‚Üí Opens the theme selector. ([blog.spoonconsulting.com][2])

If you pick a theme, NvChad prompts:

```
"Make theme changes permanent?"
```

Press **`y`** to confirm and update your configuration. ([github.com][3])

---

## Step 4: Customize NvChad

NvChad includes a **built-in theme selector** ‚Äî no manual Lua editing needed for theme changes.

### üé® Change Theme Using the Built-in UI

1. Launch Neovim:

   ```bash
   nvim
   ```

2. Press:

   ```
   <Space> ‚Üí t ‚Üí h
   ```

   This opens the **NvChad Theme Selector**.

3. Navigate through the list of available themes (e.g. `onedark`, `gruvbox`, `catppuccin`, `tokyonight`) using arrow keys.

4. Press `Enter` to preview a theme.

5. A confirmation prompt appears. Press **`y`** to make your selection permanent (updates are saved to `chadrc.lua` automatically).

---

### üìÅ Optional: Further Customization

If you want to go deeper, manually tweak the config:

```bash
nvim ~/.config/nvim/lua/custom/chadrc.lua
```

```lua
M.ui = {
  theme = "onedark",
  transparency = true,
  statusline = {
    theme = "minimal",
  },
}
```

Save and reload Neovim to apply your settings.

---

## Step 5: Add Plugins (Optional)

To add new plugins:

1. Create or edit `~/.config/nvim/lua/custom/plugins.lua`
2. Example: add [vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)

```lua
return {
  {
    "tpope/vim-surround",
    lazy = false
  }
}
```

Then restart Neovim and run:

```vim
:Lazy sync
```

## Step 6: Useful Keybindings

| Action           | Keybinding    |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| File Explorer    | `<leader> e`  |
| Fuzzy Find Files | `<leader> ff` |
| Search in Files  | `<leader> fg` |
| Toggle Terminal  | `<leader> tt` |
| Save File        | `<leader> w`  |
| Quit             | `<leader> q`  |

`<leader>` is the spacebar by default.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                        | Solution                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Icons not rendering          | Ensure Nerd Font is installed and selected     |
| No plugins loading           | Check for errors in `custom/chadrc.lua`        |
| Errors on launch             | Delete `~/.local/share/nvim` and re-run Neovim |
| Missing features (LSP, etc.) | Run `:Mason` and install required tools        |

---

## Conclusion

With NvChad, you‚Äôve got a pre-configured Neovim environment that‚Äôs fast, modern, and ready to go. Whether you're coding in Python, Rust, or web dev stacks, this setup gives you a powerful IDE-like experience right inside your terminal.

üéâ Happy hacking with Neovim!
