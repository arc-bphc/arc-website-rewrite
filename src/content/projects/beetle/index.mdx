Beetle is an autonomous car platform that uses **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** to navigate complex environments without human intervention.

It combines sensor fusion, onboard compute, and real-time decision making to explore and drive through unknown terrain while dynamically mapping its surroundings.

## Features

* Real-time SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
* GNSS and Visual-Inertial Odometry integration
* Obstacle detection and path planning
* Autonomous waypoint navigation
* Web-based dashboard and telemetry
* Modular architecture (sensors, planning, control)
* Live map visualization
* ROS2-compatible

## Technology Stack

* SLAM Backend: RTAB-Map / ORB-SLAM3
* Platform: Raspberry Pi 4 + Microcontroller
* Sensors: Stereo camera, IMU, GPS
* Navigation: A\* Pathfinding / Dijkstra
* Language: Python + C++
* Frameworks: ROS2, OpenCV, NumPy

## Applications

Beetle serves as a testbed for research in autonomous navigation, robotics education, and real-world SLAM deployment. It is adaptable for both indoor and outdoor mapping missions.
