**Striker** is a compact, manually controlled soccer robot built for fast-paced robotics competitions and experimentation with mechanical design and remote control systems.

It features a sturdy frame with a fixed metal sheet clamp at the front for ball trapping and pushing, and is driven by dual brushed DC motors controlled via a **Cytron motor driver**.

Control is handled using a **FlySky FS-i6** radio transmitter and receiver, providing low-latency directional inputs and precise control during gameplay.

## Features

* Dual DC motor drivetrain with Cytron motor driver
* FlySky receiver for wireless manual control
* Fixed front clamp for ball control and maneuvering
* Lightweight metal chassis for speed and agility
* Wide wheelbase for stability during turns
* Powered by a 2S or 3S LiPo battery pack
* Easy-to-modify design for future upgrades

## Components

* **Motors**: Brushed DC motors
* **Motor Driver**: Cytron MD10C R3
* **Controller**: FlySky FS-i6 (6-channel)
* **Chassis**: Custom metal frame with clamp
* **Power**: 7.4V / 11.1V LiPo battery
* **Wheels**: 65mm rubber grippers

## Use Cases

Striker is ideal for participating in manual-teleop soccer events, testing mechanical designs for ball interaction, or serving as a base for future autonomous upgrades with sensors and vision.
